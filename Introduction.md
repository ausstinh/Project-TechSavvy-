# Introduction  
 
### The Problem and Solution  
The questions a jobseeker in the technology field may ask are “What sort of technology career will I have, and job can I get if I want to pursue this degree?” and “I’m only curious to know what this degree has to offer but where can I go to easily find out?”. Before starting college, students in technology have a hard time figuring out what they want to do for the rest of their lives, and they are confused on whether that degree will get them their dream job. It is a lot of work to research many job sites to find out what career they might want to do after graduating college. With this application, students will have a better idea on what career they may want to pursue. This application can also help people who are simply wondering what technology jobs are being offered.

This project has many objectives to achieve. For one, the application should have two projects for back-end data and front-end display. Next, the back-end project needs to receive data using a REST API and hold it.  Data should transfer back-end data to front-end project to be displayed. A search function to retrieves job data with a keyword using REST API. Jobs should display in a nice-looking list. Lastly, a button displays next to each job that redirects user to job application.

Tech Savvy is a simple and quick way to discover your future career in technology. When a user register, they are prompted to input a job title, location, or description that will search for jobs in the field of technology. The application has the task of requesting and receiving data to display multiple jobs and their description on a table. The user has the option to view their history searches and save jobs to view in their profile. As an accomplishment, the application is made up of a .Net Core back-end and React front-end that continues to receive data using a REST API from the third-party GitHub Jobs API. Both project ends will transfer data between each other at the request of the user. The secured application has a MYSQL database that hold registered users with security caches and hashes. Both applications will be stationed on the Azure cloud.
