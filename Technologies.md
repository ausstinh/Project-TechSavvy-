### Incorporated Technologies 

### .NET Core
The decision to use .NET Core as Tech Savvy’s back end is due to familiarity. Having experience with C# and .NET Framework coding concepts and logics were easy to come by. Although I never used .NET Core, it is very similar to .NET Framework. With .NET Core setting up with the project’s MYSQL database and GitHub Jobs API as a third party was possible. The back end includes a business layer which contains services for the application and communicate with the database to request data to be retrieved or configured.
.NET Core allowed setting up REST controllers to be an easy task. Data can be transferred using the MVC design to play requested data into a object to be transferred from the controller to the business service to process the request and send back the object to the front-end application. 

### React and Material-UI
The project’s front-end uses React and to send service calls to the back-end project as well as retrieve from it. Using React was a new experience and learning the concepts and structure. React provided many key advantages to customise the front-end application and granted many libraries as an option for designing the look of the project. Material-UI was the main CSS library to provide table data and give a clean look for the user. I wanted to learn React because it is growing in populatity in the industry as well as learning Material-UI because of the simplicity in which it can display HTML elements in a new way than what I am used to.

### MYSQL  
MYSQL was chosen as the database for TechSavvy because of familiarity and popularity. It is open source, reliable, compatible with all major hosting providers, cost-effective, and easy to manage. Data security and strong transactional support is offered by MySQL to secure online transactions and enhance customer interactions. Setting up tables and relationships between them were simple using the MYSQL Workbench application. PHPMyAdmin is easy to navigate and view/alter column fields for testing purposes. Storing and retrieve data from the MYSQL datbase were possible using the MYSQL connection method in .NET Core. 

### Azure Cloud
Azure Cloud was chosen because of their services are dependable and reliable when .NET Core and React projects are required to communicate with each other. Azure is a public cloud computing platform—with solutions including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) that can be used for services such as analytics, storage, and networking. Azure Cloud provided a way for a online MYSQL database using PHPMyAdmin to connect the back-end project.
