# Risks and Challenges

### Risks
- New experience with React and components
- New experience setting up .NET Core references and startup
- Publish client and server projects to Azure Cloud

### Challenges
- Return accurate data from GitHub Jobs API
- Send HTTP requests between client and server projects
- User session in client project

### How the Risks and Challenges were Overcome
I am familiar with .NET Framework which provided a reference to use to learn .NET Core and the little changes between them. Implementing the MVC design with interface classes provided easy understanding of what methods the data will to go. React was a brand-new experience that required extensive research in concepts and component procedure. Resources that I used to overcome the risks and challenges are: YouTube, Material-UI, StackOverFlow, Microsoft docs, and Reactjs. I received much assistance from developers who frequently use React in their profession. 

### Risk Management Approaches
Risks were identified as well as mitigating them before the developing phase began. I created small proof of concept test applications to quickly mitigate risks. Test applications were made for understanding the Axios function of sending HTTP requests between projects and sending HTTP requests to the third-party GitHub Jobs API.Deploying test applications to the Azure Cloud to understand how a React and .NET Core project can communicate.
